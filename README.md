# Nvim-Words

A Neovim plugin to learn the pronunciation and definition of words.

TODO:

[x] Show the pronunciation of the word under the cursor with IPA symbols.
[ ] Show the pronunciation of the sentence under the cursor.
[ ] Show the definition of the word under the cursor.
[ ] Use a floating window instead of messages.
[ ] Handle other languages besides English.
[ ] Add the option to play sound.
[ ] Add `checkhealth` for dependencies.
[ ] Setup function with options (optional keymaps).
[ ] Visual selection to capture several words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.
- [ ] Maybe use vim motions!


FIX:

[ ] Better column count (don't just #text)
